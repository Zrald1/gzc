# GZ Programming Language AI Module

This module provides advanced AI capabilities for the GZ programming language, including:

1. **Exponential Learning**: The AI learns 100x faster with each code sample it processes
2. **Persistent Memory**: The AI never forgets patterns, optimizations, or corrections
3. **Self-Improvement**: The AI autonomously enhances its own codebase and algorithms
4. **Feedback Loop**: The AI continuously refines understanding based on execution results
5. **Transfer Learning**: The AI applies knowledge from one task to different contexts
6. **Progressive Optimization**: Optimization levels evolve as knowledge grows

## Components

### 1. AI Integration Module (`gz_ai_integration.py`)

This module provides the main interface for all AI capabilities, including:

- Code correction
- Code optimization
- Code generation
- Code explanation
- Learning from code samples

### 2. Self-Improvement Module (`gz_self_improvement.py`)

This module enables the GZ compiler to:

- Learn from user code
- Improve itself
- Automatically update the GitHub repository with new learnings

## Usage

The AI capabilities are automatically enabled when using the GZ compiler. You can control them with the following command-line options:

```bash
# Disable AI assistant
gzc program.gz --no-ai

# Set AI intelligence level (1-10)
gzc program.gz --ai-level 8

# Disable auto-correction
gzc program.gz --no-auto-correct

# Disable auto-optimization
gzc program.gz --no-auto-optimize

# Generate code from description
gzc -g "Create a program that calculates the factorial of a number" -o factorial.gz

# Explain code
gzc program.gz -e
```

## How It Works

### Exponential Learning

The AI uses an exponential learning algorithm that accelerates its learning rate as it processes more code samples. The learning rate is calculated as:

```
learning_rate = base_rate * acceleration_factor^(iterations)
```

Where:
- `base_rate` is the initial learning rate (default: 0.01)
- `acceleration_factor` is the acceleration factor (default: 100)
- `iterations` is the number of learning iterations

### Self-Improvement

The AI continuously improves itself by:

1. Learning from code corrections
2. Learning from code optimizations
3. Learning from code generation
4. Learning from code explanations

When enough improvements have been made, the AI automatically updates the GitHub repository with the new learnings, making them available to all users of the GZ programming language.

## Memory Structure

The AI's memory is organized into several categories:

- **Syntax Patterns**: Patterns of code syntax
- **Optimization Rules**: Rules for optimizing code
- **Correction Rules**: Rules for correcting code
- **Code Templates**: Templates for generating code
- **Collective Learnings**: Learnings from all users

## Contributing

You can contribute to the AI's knowledge by using the GZ compiler. Every time you compile a GZ program, the AI learns from your code and improves itself.
