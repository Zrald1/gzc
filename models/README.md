# GZ Programming Language Models

This directory contains the models and memory files used by the GZ programming language's AI capabilities.

## Files

- `collective_memory.json`: Contains the collective learnings from all users
- `learning_summary.md`: A human-readable summary of the collective learnings
- `gz_ai_model.bin`: The main AI model used by the GZ compiler (not included in the repository)

## Collective Intelligence

The GZ programming language uses a collective intelligence approach, where learnings from all users are combined to create a more powerful AI. This approach allows the GZ compiler to:

1. Learn from code corrections
2. Learn from code optimizations
3. Learn from code generation
4. Learn from code explanations

## How It Works

1. When you use the GZ compiler, it learns from your code
2. The learnings are stored in your local memory files
3. When enough new learnings have been accumulated, the GZ compiler automatically updates the GitHub repository
4. Other users get these updates when they pull from the repository or update their GZ compiler

## Memory Structure

The collective memory is organized into several categories:

- **Syntax Patterns**: Patterns of code syntax
- **Optimization Rules**: Rules for optimizing code
- **Correction Rules**: Rules for correcting code
- **Code Templates**: Templates for generating code
- **Collective Learnings**: Learnings from all users

## Contributing

You can contribute to the collective intelligence by using the GZ compiler. Every time you compile a GZ program, the AI learns from your code and improves itself.

## Privacy

The GZ compiler only collects code patterns and learnings, not your actual code. Your privacy is respected, and no personal information is collected.
